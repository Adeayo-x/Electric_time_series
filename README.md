## Electricity Demand Forecasting using Time Series
Today, electricity use is a major concern for many countries. Electricity demand forecasting helps predict how much electricity will be needed in the future. This is important for companies to know when and where peak usage will happen and to manage risks.

As the world becomes more digital, electricity demand keeps growing. Companies need to analyze their electricity use and forecast future demand to plan better.

Time series analysis is a way to study electricity use over time. It can reveal patterns, trends, and relationships in the data, helping predict future demand. In this project, Python tools like Pandas and SARIMAX are used to analyze electricity data and make forecasts.
This project analyzes electricity production as a univariate time series.
The goal is to understand its structure (trend and seasonality) and
produce short-term forecasts using classical time-series methods.

### Tools
- Programming language: Python
- Tools: Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Statsmodels.Seasonal Decompose
- Statsmodels.SARIMAX

### Methods
- Time-series visualization
- Additive and multiplicative seasonal decomposition
- SARIMA forecasting
### Key Insight
Electricity production exhibits strong seasonality whose magnitude scales
with the level of production, making multiplicative decomposition and
seasonal models appropriate.
